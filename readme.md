# Resume

The purpose of this project is to apply and practice obtained knowledge of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
This repository includes a project structure with a build script that builds a custom CSS version of Bootstrap 4, using Gulp. You can
clone this repository, run the Gulp task and go right into modifying variables and adding styles. There's also an HTML file that contains
a neatly organized collection of Bootstrap components that fit a 1920x1080 display, so you can instantly see the outcome.

## Prerequisites

- Node Package Manager and Gulp are required. Make sure you can run `gulp -v` and `npm -v`.
- You can get Node at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then install gulp using `npm install gulp-cli -g`

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Add any Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
5. Add any custom styles into `scss/_custom-styles.scss`. You can use Bootstrap's mixins here.
